# work-day-planner

Organise your day

## Description

In this project, I have designed a planner for each hour of the working day. Built with the Jquery libary, the website allows a user to enter and save information, that they have planned during the working day.

The website the following features:

- Current day at the top of the page when a user opens the planner.
- Timeblocks for each hour of the working day - colour coded
- The red time block represents the current hour, and moves down the page as the time changes.
- A user can enter an activity when they click a textarea and save it by clicking the blue button.

This site uses moment.js to track the time, and local storage to keep any data the user wishes to save.

## Usage

To use the daily planner, enter your daily to do tasks, and click the blue save button. Your tasks will be saved for the day. As the red colour block enters the task to do, this is when to do the task. After completetion, delete the task and press save, to empty the task slot.
